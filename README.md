Amaize is a first-person, 3d, horror maze runner game where you play as a sentient piece of corn, navigating through a randomly generated corn maze while being chased by Farmer Brown on his tractor.
You will find items along the way such as bombs to blow up the walls of the maze to create shortcuts, and trampolines to jump over walls and to see your position within the maze.
Find your way to the rocket ship located somewhere on the map to win. Get caught by Farmer Brown, and you lose.
